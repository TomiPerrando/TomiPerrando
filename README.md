## Introduction

"*â€” I turn raw data into easy-to-read information...*"

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tomi

I'm a nerdy guy from Argentina who is trying to become a Data Scientist, I'll probably apply to some Data Analyst jobs too though...

If you're a recruiter, I highly recommend you to go on to the portfolio repository, those are projects intended to show my skills and learning process so you know if I'm a good fit for the role you're searching people for. Things out of there may get a little bit random (?)
